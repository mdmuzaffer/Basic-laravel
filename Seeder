How to create seeder in Laravel and use it.
I have written following steps with command and code.

Create Seeder Command:
1. php artisan make:seeder AdminTableSeeder

after run above command, it will create one file AdminUserSeeder.php on seeds folder. All seed classes are stored in the database/seeds directory.
Then you can write code of create admin user using model in laravel.
database/seeds/AdminTableSeeder.php
